## Overview
This application is a user-friendly search engine that enables users to find their favorite movies and TV shows quickly. Users can search for titles using keywords. Once a user searches for a title, our application will display a list of all relative titles to the search Query. Once the correct Title is found further information can be retrieved from clicking on the title card. Once clicked a Modal will open showing more information on the title as well as all available streaming platforms with link. Users can save/favorite titles they are interested in, and these titles will be displayed later on their profile page for convenient access. Our application is designed to make it easy for users to find and save titles they want to watch, and it provides a comprehensive search experience for movie and TV show enthusiasts.
